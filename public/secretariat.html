                    Anime keeps him twitchy and jittery. Research gives him ideas that are extreme, reckless, and probably illegal. Political opinions? Absolute chaos. No one sane can follow them, and that’s exactly the point.

                    Mistakes stick to him like flies. Sanity avoids him. Patience doesn’t exist in his vocabulary. He doesn’t lead, just guides things from the sidelines.
